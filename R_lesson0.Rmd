### Pros
- Free (as in "free speech", but also as in "free beer")
- It runs on all platforms (Windows, Mac or Linux)
- Can be extended with packages
- Large community: easy to get help
- R supports fairly large datasets (assuming you have enough RAM)

### Cons
- You have to learn how to use a scripting language
- R natively supports only fairly large datasets
